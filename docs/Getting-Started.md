## üì¢ Information Credit

The information on this site is mostly derived from two reputable sources, <a href="https://owasp.org/" target="_blank">Open Web Application Security Project</a> and <a href="https://www.nist.gov/" target="_blank">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a>. Other sources will be included here as the number of topics covered grows.

## üö¥ How to use

Each topic has a checklist that contains security considerations that are recommended but are not required. If you are considering using a checklist for your project, be advised that this should not be a rule to follow. The severity level associated with each item on the checklist represents its importance. It is up to you to decide which one is more appropriate for your project. If you need any clarification, please reach out.
